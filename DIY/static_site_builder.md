<h2> Static site builder </h2>
<p class=""> For a static website, you should use a static site builder such as <a target="_new" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. These are frameworks that you use to centralise your site, and they are an excellent way to keep your site consistent. I prefer Jekyll, mostly because I found it was very easy to set up on Linux. This site was developed using Jekyll.</p>
<p class=""> Set Jekyll up, preferably on Linux or MacOS. If you have Windows, I recommend installing Virtualbox and running Linux as a virtual machine. The reason is that Linux and MacOS are a more natural and intuitive programming environment and work really well with the tools. The documentation on installing Jekyll assumes you are working in a Linux environment. This was easy for me because I have always preferred not to use Windows.</p>
<p>If you are working on Jekyll and some of your raw html code is being displayed on the browser window, it means there is an error in your HTML code - the parser checks for correct code and isn't as forgiving as a web browser. If you see code in the browser, there is an error in your code. </p>
