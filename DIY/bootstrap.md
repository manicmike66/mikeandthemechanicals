<p class=""> You should also use this framework for your styles and javascript. You don't even need to download Bootstrap, provided you have a consistent Internet connection.  </p>
<p>Steps to using Bootstrap are listed at <a target="_new" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/</a> and I would also urge you to link to the recommended javascript file, which are linked as close as possible to the bottom of your HTML code (just before the &lt;/body&gt;).</p>
<p> Advantages of using bootstrap include having access to a huge amount of pre-defined code. For example, if I want to put a space above a paragraph, I could fiddle about with style code, or just remember that bootstrap calls space between areas m (for margin). Spacing is particularly simple in bootstrap, mt-1 means put a margin at the top, and make it the smallest amount. If you want a bigger space, there is 2, 3 and 4. If you want a different side, you have t, b, l and r (these letters stand for what you think). Additionally, you can do top and bottom at the same time with y (the y axis) and of course x is both left and right. I suggest you experiement with this. If instead you want padding - that is, inside a paragraph you want the text to keep its distance from the paragraph's border, use p instead of m. All the rules are the same for setting the distances. If you just want a small padding on the top and slightly more on the right, you would just add class="mt-2 mr-3" to your paragraph. To apply padding or margin distancing for all sides, just don't specify one, like p-2. If I wanted the paragraph to have, say, a <span class="p-1 bg-danger text-light"> small all round padding, red background and light coloured text</span>, I make it &lt;p class="m-1 bg-danger text-light"&gt;. </p>
