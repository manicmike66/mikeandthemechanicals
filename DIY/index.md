<p class="has-large-font-size">Your ability to create your own site depends on how comfortable you are with web technologies. If you created your own when the web was young, you may be in for a surprise. A lot of changes have happened, and catching up means learning a new way to look at all of this.</p>
<p class="has-large-font-size">There are also new standards. Unless you want to exclude a lot of your audience, you will need to consider accessibility for the disabled (most obviously, people who are viaually impaired).</p>
<p class="has-large-font-size">So, where you start depends on your history with site design. I have written my guide assuming you are a complete beginner, and that you require a simple website. Anything more complex and you will need a content management system.</p>
