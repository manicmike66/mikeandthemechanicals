<li class="has-large-font-size">Service sewing machines (and not just mechanical machines).</li>
<li class="has-large-font-size">Fix sewing machines. We work on machines that other technicians may not be able to fix or might not want to allocate the time. 1970s Husqvarnas are an excellent example of an excellent machine that most technicians avoid.</li>
<li class="has-large-font-size">Restore sewing machines. We can restore just about any vintage sewing machine, including re-plating.</li>
<li class="has-large-font-size">Can rewire and electrically test old sewing machines.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-large-font-size">If you want to make your old machine run like new (or as close as possible), get in touch to discuss it or to just book a service.</p>
