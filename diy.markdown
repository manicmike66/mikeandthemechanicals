<h2>You can do it</h2>
<p class="has-large-font-size">Vintage machines are wonderful in their simplicity and they were made not only without an end date (they were made to last forever), but straight stitch machines were also made with self-servicing in mind. How do I know this? First of all, instructions for maintenance are printed in the manual.</p>
<p class="has-large-font-size">There are just a couple of very basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean before oiling</li>
<li>One drop per oiling point. The oiling points are shown in diagrams in the user manual. In reality, you don't even need to read this. Anywhere metal rubs against metal, apply oil. With Singer straight stitch machine gears, you are also supposed to use oil.</li>
</ul>
