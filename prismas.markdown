<h2>How good are they?</h2>
<p class="has-large-font">
They're pretty good, as far as computerised machines go. But, as with all Husqvarnas, they have weaknesses.
</p>
<h2>The Weaknesses</h2>
<p class="has-large-font">
The accessory tray. Both the front and rear plastic flaps can break.
</p>
<p class="has-large-font">
Electronics. Components on the circuit boards can burn out. Also, components on the power board. The most common to burn out are diodes and capacitors. I currently have a 950 board that has a blown diode. I replaced the diode and this blew immediately. Making the board work again involves determing and replacing whatever is causing the diodes to burn out. The capacitor is the most likely cause. I'll need to remove components and test them.
