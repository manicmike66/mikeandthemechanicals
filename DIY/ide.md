<h2> An IDE </h2>
<p class=""> I use <a target="_new" href="//www.vim.org">vim</a> and gvim, but Microsoft's <a target="_new" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio Code</a> is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS and is probably a better choice for most people.  Using an IDE to edit your site makes things a lot easier. The code syntax is highlighted, as well as the row numbers, so you can easily get to the source of any problem without having to count.<br/>
IDEs will help you pick up where there is a missing closing tag both by highlighting the syntax and with error messages.
<br/>If you're already a programmer, you might already be using vim. I prefer it because I can easily record macros, cutting down time taken for time-consuming tasks, but it's not trivial to learn how to use it.</p>
