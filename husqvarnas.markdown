<h2>Husqvarna 2000s</h2>
<p class="has-large-font">
The machine I would have if I could only have one is the Husqvarna 2000 but when I first came across these I really didn't like them. </p>
<h3>The Problems</h3>
<ol>
<li class="has-large-font">
They had plastic covers and almost everywhere place the self tapping screws went in, the plastic had either split or come away from its anchor. </li>
<li class="has-large-font">
They always seemed to be seized</li>
<li class="has-large-font">
The cam stack/gears were almost always broken, meaning they couldn't do a zig-zag and had a tight spot.</li>
<li class="has-large-font">
The buttonhole mechanism never seems to work</li>
<li class="has-large-font">
one of the metal gears inside the pattern mechanism breaks easily (it usually breaks when people force the pattern dial while seized).</li>
<li class="has-large-font">
They have a sliding part in the take-up lever that has a plastic component which often breaks.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-large-font">
It certainly seems like they have very little going for them, and almost every other technician I know (certainly all of them in Melbourne) hate working on these because of all these problems. <br/>
After getting one of them working perfectly a couple of years ago, I absolutely loved the result. It's now my favourite machine, and I have been concentrating on this model more than any other to make as many as possible work perfectly.</p>
<p class="has-large-font">
Then a lady contacted me through a worldwide Facebook group I was accidentally given the admin of. By an incredible coincidence she happened to live in the same city as me (Brisbane).
She asked if I could tell her what she could do with a load of old machines she had inherited. She sent pictures and most of the Singers I liked and all of the European machines were well represented. <br/>
There were 32 in all, and six of them were Husqvarna 2000s. Her ex father in law had been a technician who appreciated a really well engineered machine and kept his favourites where possible.
I couldn't understand why an ex-technician would love these gummed up broken things so as to have so many. All but one had a broken camstack/gear. 
Replacement camstacks are available but retail at $110, making it not really worthwhile. <br/>
I agreed to fix as many machines as possible and sell them and we would split the money. I held the Husqvarnas until the more familiar Berninas and Elnas were all fixed up and sold. <br/>
It took me months and months to figure these out. They are purely mechanical but complex and the reason they tend to be stuck was their sintered bearings, with lubricant inside. The idea was that when a machine was used, the bearing warms up and the lubricand siftens, letting a little run into the bearing.<br/>
The problems start when they are left for several years without use. The lubricant leaks out then hardens like wax while in the mechanisms (it is the same colour and feel as wax).
</p>
<h3>The plastic covers</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">Once they're broken the best you can do is to try and glue the broken pieces back on. If they're not there, you can sticky tape or glue them, or maybe find one that's good. Not one of these is in any way ideal, so if you have a Husqvarna 2000 that you really want to disassemble and the anchors are intact, you should be armed with the knowledge that they will stay intact unless you cross thread the self tapping screws, or put the wrong type of screw in. It's really that simple. These points only split when the original screws aren't replaced properly. Turn the screw back before turning it forward and you can feel when it lands in the original hole. Remember, if it doesn't, it's not fixable, so be take care.</p>
<h3>Un-seizing</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
There are two ways to get rid of the waxy stuff. The first is to use a hot air source to blow onto it, which softens the wax. When it's softened, you brush chemicals (methylated spirits and mineral turpentine) into it using a toothbrush while applying slight pressure to the stuck mechanism. Repeat until it's moving freely. This sounds easy, but it's not. Sometimes you need to do this for several hours, and when it's freed up you relax, have a cup of something and when you come back it's seized again. This is because it has cooled and the wax, which was still there only soft, has hardened again. So, repeat until it doesn't harden when cooled. The same thing has to be done to the rest of the machine, but the pattern mechanism is always the worst. The buttonhole mechanism is the second worst. Then the reverse mechanism, which is always stuck in reverse when it has been left for years. The feed lift is usually stuck too. <br/>
I now use the second method, which is to remove the mechanisms from the machine, disassemble them, clean, grease, reassemble and put them back in the machine. This isn't easy either, and until I became very familiar with them I broke a lot of parts. It was very fortunate that I had a lot of parts machines.</p>
<h3>Cam stack</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
These are $110 RRP. If yours is broken (and it's obvious when it is by just looking at it), it might make you feel better if you know that you'll never buy such a machine new ever again. If it's in otherwise good condition, the gear is well worth the money. They aren't that difficult to put in, and there are videos about how to do it. If you're lucky, you won't have to re-time the zig-zag. If you're not confident, get a technician to do it.<br/> It might make you feel better to know that they do last about forty years.</p>
<h3>The buttonhole mechanism</h3>
<p class="has-large-font"><img class="rounded float-start p-2" alt="Husqvarna stitch width and buttonhole mechanism" src="{{ "assets/images/width_mechanism.png" | relative_url }}"/>This usually happens when the rest of the machine has seized due to lack of use. The solution can be a bit brutal. The inner and outer shafts get glued together, and you have to separate them, then align the cutout. It's not an easy one to fix, and requires quite a bit of force. If you're really lucky, you can do this without damaging the surfaces. When it's quite free, align the cutout for the buttonhole mechanism and test thoroughly before declaring success.
</p>
<h3>Broken pattern mechanism gear</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
If you break one or more cogs, the inner part of the pattern selector will no longer line up with the marks. It's not a game over situation, but you will have to be comfortable with it not showing you what it's set to. The gears are almost impossible to find and nobody makes replacements.
</p>
<h3>Take up slide</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
The problem can be seen when the thread take up lever is sloppy. It's not a common issue thankfully, because replacements are really expensive. Most people would try and glue the plastic.
</p>
<h3>Specialising</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
Although I repair anything, I specialise in Husqvarna 2000s that other technicians won't work on, or will sometimes overquote on so you will choose not to get your machine fixed at all.
