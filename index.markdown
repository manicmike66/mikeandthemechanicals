<h2>About</h2>
<p class="has-large-font">I started out as a person who wanted to learn to sew, but having an interest and talent for machine repair, I also learned this. When living in Brisbane, I was offered a job as a sewing machine technician, focussing on older machines, but also working on modern machines. I worked there for a few years then moved to Melbourne.<br/>I have a broad knowledge of sewing machines and took an interest in older models that were exceptionally well engineered.</p>
<p class="has-large-font">Here is what I like to use personally:
Initially, my preferred machines were Singer sewing machines, the straight stitch (12, 15, 27, 28, 127, 128, 221, 222), swing needle (206, 306, 319, 320) and slant shank (401, 411) models.<br/>
After this my friend persuaded me to look at older European machines and I absolutely loved them. Swiss made Elnas and Berninas, Swedish made Husqvarnas (especially the 2000 and the earlier green machines - see logo), Italian made Necchis and Borlettis. There is something about European made machines that feels lovelier than the Japanese ones. Although the Japanese machines are competent and reliable and will get the job done, I found that they don't make you look forward to using them, whereas the European machines do. One exception might be the Japanese made Janome memory crafts. I own one of these and they are very pleasant to use. Their weakness, as with all computerised machines, is the electronics. If you're lucky, your computerised machine will never break down. If you're slightly less lucky, it will but you can get the components or there's someone who can fix it for you. If you're unlucky, nobody can fix it and parts are not available.</p>
