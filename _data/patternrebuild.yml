  caption: A Husqvarna pattern just after removal. The waxy lube is obvious, and is also present on shafts and between gears, effectively acting as glue.

  caption: With the arm removed. This is secured usually with a circlip (I have circlip pliers) as well as two nuts on two dished washers and an off-centre screw. You must keep these in the same order. Later models have a single nylon (self-locking) nut.

  caption: Remove the washer clamping down the pattern gear, then the locking pin and all of the gears. I usually need to apply some heat in order to soften the lubricant. Be extremely careful removing these. The gears are very easy to break so don't apply any pressure anywhere except to the inside where there are less breakable parts. You don't need to remove the automatic feed arm, just clean it in place. This way you won't need to remove the star washer.

  caption: Here are all the parts. Clean everything in methylated spirits and mineral turpentine solvent using a toothbrush to scrub. Dry them throughly then you will be ready to put them back. I lubricate everything with a teflon grease as I'm reassembling, but you could use tri-flow, as recommended by Husqvarna.

  caption: Here are all the two bottom gears. The outer (bottom) one is turned and kept fully clockwise whilst the gears are being reassembled, so that it sits in the left zig-zag position. The next gear is inserted, then the pin is put back in. Align the mark on the inner gear so that it is as close as possible to the post, as per the photo.

  caption: The next gear goes back onto the post, lubricated. Note the alignment mark, which matches up with the inner gear. Do not screw the clamping part on yet. The tricky part is next.

  caption: I usually put a little grease into the channel as well as onto the gears. You have to hold the black metal part into the channel, align the alignment marks and insert the gear, all at the same time. The black part is at the end of the channel, since alignment occurs at the extreme clockwise position. Once this is on, you can screw the clamp on. Make sure that neither edge is hitting the central gear.

  caption: After securing the central gear, put the front parts (coloured ring and the dial) and make sure you can turn it to every pattern. You will need to hold the black metal part upright or it will get stuck. You can now put some other parts back as per the photo. The black forked metal piece settles into a cutout every time a pattern is selected. Applying a little pressure you will be able to see how this works. Put the spring back into the central gears.

  caption: The arm must be reassembled and goes on before the gear and camstack. Put it back on but be aware that you will need to loosen the horizontal screw on the right again in order to align the zigzag follower. This is done before putting the mechanism back into the machine. Put the gear in, lubricate the shaft then put the camstack in and secure it with the screw.

  caption: At this point, reattach the pattern tension arm onto the automatic feed arm, making sure the spring goes onto the appropriate spot on the other arm. Put the indicator and dial back again and now you can check that everything works. Now that the camstack is in, you should now set the alignment of the zig-zag follower. When it is set, tighten the screw and you're almost ready to put it back into the machine.

  caption: You will probably need to adjust the ZZ swing, so loosen the two screws holding the shaft gear and try to turn it. If it's seized, remove both of the grub screws, and spray methylated spirits in both of the holes. Now you need to force the shaft to turn without the gear moving. Keeping it from moving isn't easy, but I've found that putting a long screw onto the grub screw threads makes it much easier. Since using the hand wheel would break it, remove it and attach some vise-grips. Use these to turn the main shaft carefully while making sure the screw can't move (use tools or the frame to stop it moving). Once it starts to move, spray a bit more, then move the gear to the left and clean the shaft. Apply a little oil, move it back into position and insert and lighty tighten the grub screws.

  caption: Now you can put the pattern mechanism back, putting the light housing and lead over the top of the metal part. Make sure the buttonhole control lever is safely off to the left. Reattach the spring for the light and push it on. It will click into the correct position. Make sure the auto feed is correctly inserted.

  caption: Reattach this and carefully put the circlip back on. Put the pattern mechanism screw back and tighten it. The buttonhole control's U can be carefully put back underneath the corresponding part on the pattern mechanism. Put the indication ring and dial on the front and your pattern mechanism should now turn easily and work perfectly.
