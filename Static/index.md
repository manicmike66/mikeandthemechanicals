<p>If you dont need a CMS, then you can probably go cheap, fast and potentially completely free.</p>
<p>If you have decided a static site will suit your needs. You can now either <a target="_new" href="/DIY">create it yourself</a> or have me do it.</p>
<p> If you're developing using Jekyll and git, you can <a target="_new" href="//docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">have github host your site completely free of charge</a>.</p>
<p>I have done this before and although it took a bit of fiddling, it was very successful. Using Jekyll meant I could have some data sources serve out lists of files automatically (it creates the static HTML code).</p>
