<h2>Rebuilding a seized 2000</h2>
<h3>This takes a lot of work</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
The fact that I love repairing Husqvarnas means I will repair them. As mentioned, technicians avoid these due to the work involved. In the past I haven't performed a full restoration of a seized and broken 2000 from &ldquo;unused for decades&rdquo; condition for someone else. This changed when a lady came into the shop on Thursday afternoon (20/7/23) with a 6460 that hadn't been used for a very long time. It was completely seized, the reverse was stuck, the camstack was broken, the buttonhole function seized, the motor brushes worn out but it looked in excellent condition otherwise. I started prior to 6am on Friday morning (probably at 5:50) and finished the test sew at 2:05pm, having taken a total of about 15 minutes for breaks (customers picking up and dropping machines off). That's *eight hours of work* by someone who has a lot of experience with these, and there wasn't anything unusually troublesome about it.
So the lesson is that even for an experienced repairer, it takes a very long time to fix one of these.

<h3>Removing the pattern mechanism</h3>
<p class="has-large-font">
Do not attempt to force the dial, or you will break the pattern indicator gear. 
</p>
<p class="has-large-font">
After much trial and error, I discovered that it is possible to remove the pattern mechanism as a single unit. I advise you to take plenty of photos if you want to do this, as well as downloading the service manual from either the Husqvarna groups.io or the facebook group.

<p class="has-large-font">
First of all, if it's stuck in buttonhole mode, put it on stage 2, which makes it much easier to disconnect things. There are three points to disconnect: The fork-shaped metal connection to the front of the stitch width mechanism - use a flat screwdriver to pry it away from the pattern mechanism then push it left until it stays out of the way, the two part spring loaded connector that goes from the back of the stitch width mechanism to the top and is secured with a circlip. Remove the light fitting (there is a single flat screw visible when you pull the cover down). Remove the screw holding the front dial, then the big screw at the back. You don't need to remove the camstack separately with this instruction.
</p>
<p class="has-large-font">
Manipulate the zig-zag lever (just to the right of the camstack) so it isn't in the way. Use the tilted part that the light fitting screws to to assist here, and put the light fitting cord over this (the light fitting will stay on the machine) and once it's free you should be able to get it back. There is a spring surrounding the light wiring and it needs to be unhooked from the pattern mechanism. After this, it will come out of the machine as a unit. Be aware that the automatic feed actuator (the leftmost part of the pattern unit) can fall when you remove the unit. Once the unit is out, you should carefully disassemble it and clean the wax from every part. It's very important that you don't force anything. The gears can break quite easily.

Bear in mind that this is ony one of the three components you need to free up.
