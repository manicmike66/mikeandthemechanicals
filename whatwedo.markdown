<li class="">Service sewing machines (and not just mechanical machines).</li>
<li class="">Fix sewing machines. We work on machines that other technicians may not be able to fix or might not want to allocate the time. 1970s Husqvarnas are an excellent example of an excellent machine that most technicians avoid, because they often take a lot of time to repair properly. They will often avoid telling the customer and will instead say that it can't be fixed.</li>
<li class="">Restore sewing machines. We can restore just about any vintage sewing machine, including re-plating parts where the original plating has gone.</li>
<li class="">Rewire and electrically test old sewing machines. I am a licensed test and tagger.</li>

<p class="has-large-font-size">If you want to make your old machine run like new (or as close as possible), get in touch to discuss it or to just book a service.</p>
